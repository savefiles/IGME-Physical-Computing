# Remotely Controlling LEDs
Breanna's blog post: https://github.com/B-Hen/IGME-470-Blog/wiki/Network-Communication

Breanna and I were both on the RIT-Legacy network. We had originally tried the code from the lab and quickly realized that the lab code had no way of connected to the other person's Arduino. However, in class today (Monday), we used the new code, and it ended up working!

We ran into a few issues trying to control the other person's LEDs (mostly not my fault :smile:), but we eventually got it to work. One thing we had to mess with was the order of connection, because apparently it only really wanted to work when I connected second (e.g. partner had their Arduino started first, then I started mine). Not exactly sure why. If you want to see a video of it, check out Breanna's blog post.
