Empty Vessels is a visual/audio experience, that utilizes artificial intelligence to compose and play music using three cellos. The creators, David Gardener and Greg Debicki, worked with the Society for Arts and Technology in Montreal to turn their idea of robotic cellos into a reality. With a timeframe of only two and a half months, they managed to create a stunning performance that sold out audiences for two whole weeks.

## How does it work?
The cellos are controlled using the software [MAX MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) hooked up to an Arduino per cello. Each Arduino is connected to two [RoboClaw Motor Controllers](https://www.pololu.com/product/3284), which control the motors and allow the 3D printed slides to move to precise positions along the fingerboard. To prevent overheating of the motors, there is a small fan pointed at the group of motors for each cello.

## Where is it now?
Empty Vessels was slated to perform another week and a half of performances at the Society of Arts and Technology in Montreal, with a European tour later in 2020, but due to the outbreak, both were postponed until further notice. The project was also designed to play in a museum environment, changing the intensity of the music it plays depending on the number of audience members.
